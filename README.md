# Trou Contracts

This repo contains a curated list of my self-made smart contracts. 
I made them for my own experimental purposes and published them publicly so that everyone can inspect and help improve the code if needed.

I will try to make sure they have as much as possible test coverage, however the contracts will be mainly non-audited. 

Therefore, hopefully the contracts will be delivered transparent, secured and reliable when being used as a software/platform to the community.

# Available Contracts

- [Lock](./contracts/Lock): just a sample contract, will be removed soon lol
- [PokerDeck](./contracts/PokerDeck): an algorithm-generated NFT inspired by Poker hands.
- BondCake: an innovative bonding mechanism relied on Cake compound staking (in progress)

# Test

To run tests, execute the commands below

```bash
yarn install
yarn test
